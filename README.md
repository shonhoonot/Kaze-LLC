# 風 Kaze Shop

Japan → Mongolia proxy-buying & cargo-consolidation e-commerce platform for **Kaze LLC**.

Customers in Mongolia browse Japanese products (Amazon JP, Uniqlo, GU, …), order in **MNT**,
and Kaze LLC buys the goods in Japan, bags them per customer, consolidates bags into a 25 kg
box, and ships by sea cargo. Customers pay: **product cost + markup + per-item service fee +
weight-based shipping fee.**

UI language: **Mongolian (Cyrillic)**. Prices in **MNT** (JPY shown as secondary).

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # then edit secrets
docker compose up --build
# backend  → http://localhost:8000  (docs at /docs)
# frontend → http://localhost:3000

# seed demo data (3 categories, 12 products, admin user, open box)
docker compose exec backend python -m app.seed
```

Demo admin: log in with phone **+97699000000** (OTP is returned in the API
response while `OTP_DEV_MODE=true`).

## Local dev (without Docker)

**Backend**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://kaze:kaze_dev_password@localhost:5432/kaze
python -m app.seed
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 npm run dev
```

## The pricing engine (`backend/app/pricing.py`)

The single source of truth for customer-facing prices. **All money math is integer JPY**;
MNT is computed only at the very end (for display/charging).

```
markup_jpy        = round(base_price_jpy * markup_percent)        # per unit, × qty
service_fee_jpy   = service_fee_per_item_jpy * qty
shipping_fee_jpy  = round(weight_grams/1000 * shipping_fee_per_kg) # per unit, × qty
line_total_jpy    = base*qty + markup + service_fee + shipping_fee
display_mnt       = round(line_total_jpy * fx_rate_jpy_mnt)
```

Defaults (admin-editable in `/admin/pricing`): markup 10%, service fee ¥400/item,
shipping ¥350/kg, FX 22.5 ₮/¥. Rules are overridable at **product > category > global**
precedence (see `services/pricing_service.py`).

Run the unit tests:
```bash
cd backend && python -m pytest
```

## Order pipeline

`PLACED → PAID → PURCHASING_IN_JP → RECEIVED_AT_JP_WAREHOUSE → PACKED → SHIPPED_CARGO →
ARRIVED_MN → READY_FOR_PICKUP → DELIVERED` (+ `CANCELLED`, `REFUNDED`).

Each transition writes an `order_event`, surfaced to the customer as a visual tracker
(`/orders/[id]`). Shipping a box auto-advances all its orders to `SHIPPED_CARGO`.

---

## Key routes

**Customer:** `/` · `/category/[slug]` (filter + sort) · `/product/[id]` · `/cart` ·
`/checkout` · `/orders` · `/orders/[id]` · `/account` · `/wishlist` ·
`/notifications` · `/login` · `/how-it-works` · `/faq` · `/shipping-info`

**Admin/staff:** `/admin` (dashboard) · `/admin/products` · `/admin/pricing` ·
`/admin/orders` (kanban) · `/admin/boxes` (consolidation tool)

**API:** see interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

---

## Admin: bulk add products

- **Manual**: `/admin/products` — paste an Amazon JP / Uniqlo / GU URL and fill in
  title/price/weight/image (no scraping — respects retailer ToS).
- **CSV**: `POST /admin/products/import` (multipart `file`). See
  `backend/sample_products.csv` for the column format.

---

## Deployment notes

- Containerized for **Azure Container Apps** or a **Contabo VPS** (Docker + nginx).
- Frontend builds as a Next.js standalone server.
- Backend exposes `/health` for health checks.
- Object storage: `STORAGE_BACKEND=local` (served at `/uploads`) or `azure_blob`.
- **Secrets** live in env vars / Key Vault — never hardcoded. See `.env.example`.
- For production schema evolution, add Alembic migrations (v1 uses `create_all`).

## Conversion / UX features

- **Estimated ship & arrival date** — projected from the open box's fill rate
  (`BOX_FILL_GRAMS_PER_DAY` + `JP_HANDLING_DAYS` + `SEA_TRANSIT_DAYS`); shown on
  the home/cart box-fill bar to drive urgency.
- **Wishlist** — save products (`♡`), view at `/wishlist` (`/wishlist` API).
- **Sort** — products by newest / price asc / price desc.
- **Referral program** — each user gets a code + shareable link
  (`/login?ref=CODE`); referrer earns credit, referee gets a one-time
  service-fee discount on their first order.

## Order tracking & trust features

- **Status timeline** — every order advance (placed → paid → purchasing →
  received → packed → shipped → arrived → delivered) writes an `OrderEvent`,
  rendered as a vertical tracker on the order detail page.
- **In-app notifications** — each status change (and warehouse photo) creates a
  `Notification`; customers see a 🔔 bell with an unread badge (polled every
  60s) and a `/notifications` feed (`/notifications` API + mark-read).
- **Warehouse photos** — staff attach proof photos to an order
  (`POST /admin/orders/{id}/photos`); shown as a gallery on the order page to
  build buyer trust. All status side-effects are centralised in
  `services/notifications.record_order_event`.

## Admin / operations

- **Dashboard** — today's & this-month revenue/orders, pending-payment count,
  average margin, active product count, open-box fill, plus an order
  status-breakdown bar chart (`GET /admin/dashboard`).
- **Product management** — admin catalogue list (`GET /admin/products`,
  includes inactive) with search (name/brand/SKU), category & active filters,
  and pagination; soft-delete + one-click reactivate.
- **Bulk CSV import** — upload a CSV (`POST /admin/products/import`) with
  per-row error reporting; UI on the admin products page.
- **Referral credit redemption** — accrued `referral_credit_jpy` is now spent
  at checkout (capped at the order total, never negative) and the balance is
  decremented; previously it was a display-only dead balance.
- **Help / FAQ & contact** — a `/contact` page with an FAQ accordion and a
  public message form (`POST /contact`, links to the user when signed in);
  staff triage submissions under `/admin/contact` (filter open/done, toggle
  handled).
- **Live FX rate** — `POST /admin/fx/refresh` pulls the current JPY→MNT rate
  from a public rates API (`services/fx`, default open.er-api.com, base JPY)
  and writes it to the global pricing rule (mode → live). The admin pricing
  page has an "Амьд татах" button; failures (blocked network / bad response)
  surface as a clear message instead of corrupting the rate.
- **Recently viewed** — product views are tracked client-side in
  localStorage (`lib/recentlyViewed`, deduped, capped at 8) and surfaced as a
  "Сүүлд үзсэн" section on the home page and product detail (excluding the
  current item). No backend or account needed.
- **Home page & rating sort** — the landing page adds a hero search box, a
  3-step "how it works" strip, a ⭐ top-rated section, and a custom-request
  banner; backed by a new `sort=rating` option on `/products` (orders by
  average rating, then review count).
- **Image uploads** — `POST /admin/uploads` (staff) accepts an image file
  (JPG/PNG/WEBP/GIF, ≤5MB), stores it via a pluggable `services/storage`
  backend (local disk served at `/uploads`, or Azure Blob), and returns its
  URL. The admin product form can upload a photo inline instead of pasting a
  URL.
- **Out-of-stock handling** — the `in_stock` flag is now enforced end-to-end:
  adding a sold-out item to the cart is blocked, checkout refuses if anything
  in the cart sold out (naming the items), and reorder skips it. Storefront
  shows a "Дууссан" badge / disabled buy button; admins toggle stock from the
  products list.
- **Sign in with Google** — `POST /auth/google` verifies a Google ID token
  (`services/google_auth`, lazy-imported) and links it to an existing email
  account or creates a new one (phone is now optional; users carry a
  `google_sub`). The login page shows a Google button via Google Identity
  Services. Credentials (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`)
  are wired through config/env but left blank — set them later to enable; until
  then the endpoint returns a clear "not configured" error and the button shows
  a placeholder.
- **Profile editing** — `PATCH /auth/me` lets a signed-in customer update
  name / email / city / district / default address (email normalised +
  uniqueness-checked); the account page has an inline edit form that refreshes
  the auth context on save.
- **Reorder** — one click re-adds every still-available item from a past
  order back into the cart (`POST /cart/reorder/{id}`), merging quantities and
  skipping deactivated products (reported back). Available on the order list
  (with status-filter tabs) and the order detail page.
- **Custom product requests** — customers paste a Japanese URL for an item
  not in the catalogue (`POST /requests`); the scraper snapshots
  title/price/image best-effort, and staff work a queue
  (`/admin/requests`) to quote a price, mark fulfilled, or reject — each
  decision pushes a notification. Customer-facing `/request` page lists their
  requests with live status.
- **Storefront search** — a header search box (desktop input + mobile icon)
  and a dedicated `/search` page with debounced live querying, category /
  max-price / sort filters, shareable `?q=` URLs, and load-more pagination,
  all backed by the existing `/products` query params.
- **Order cancellation** — customers can cancel an order
  (`POST /orders/{id}/cancel`) only while it's still `PLACED`/`PAID` (before we
  start buying in Japan); paid orders flip to `refunded` and the reason is
  captured on the order timeline. The order page shows an inline confirm with
  an optional reason.
- **Reviews & ratings** — one star rating + comment per user per product
  (`/products/{id}/reviews` GET/POST-upsert/DELETE), with a verified-buyer
  badge when the reviewer has ordered the product. Aggregates
  (`services/reviews`) surface `avg_rating` + `review_count` on every product
  card and detail page (batched to avoid N+1), with a star-distribution
  breakdown and inline write/edit form. Demo reviews are seeded.
- **Address book** — customers save multiple delivery addresses
  (`/addresses` CRUD) with exactly one default enforced server-side; checkout
  offers saved addresses as radio cards (default pre-selected) or a new-address
  form that can be saved inline, and the account page manages the book. The
  order's `delivery_address` snapshot is built from the address's `formatted`
  property.
- **Coupons / discounts** — percent (with optional JPY cap) or fixed-JPY codes
  with min-subtotal, usage-limit and expiry guards. Customers preview the
  discount against their live cart (`POST /coupons/validate`) and apply it at
  checkout; admins manage codes under `/admin/coupons`. Discount math lives in
  `services/coupons` (integer JPY, never exceeds the merchandise subtotal) and
  stacks with the referral discount. Seeded demo code: `WELCOME10`.
- **URL product sourcing** — paste a Japanese product URL
  (`POST /admin/products/scrape`) to auto-fill title / price / image / brand
  from JSON-LD + OpenGraph tags. Dependency-free (`services/scraper`), source
  guessed from the domain, and degrades gracefully when the network is blocked
  or a page is bot-walled — the admin reviews/edits before saving.

## Roadmap hooks (left intentionally open)

- Real SMS provider for OTP (`SMS_PROVIDER`).
- Live FX daily job writing into the global pricing rule (`FX_MODE=live`).
- Product importer/scraper — **manual + CSV only** for v1 (ToS-safe).
- LendMN payment provider (add alongside QPay behind `PaymentProvider`).
- NOVA agent / WhatsApp · Messenger · Telegram contact integration.
- Referral program (codes + credits) — schema in place, UI on `/account`.
